A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). 
In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. 
In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

Consider the following example code : 1
function makeFunc() {
  const name = "Mozilla";
  function displayName() {
    console.log(name);
  }
  return displayName;
}

const myFunc = makeFunc();
myFunc();

What's different (and interesting) is that the displayName() inner function is returned from the outer function before being executed.
At first glance, it might seem unintuitive that this code still works. In some programming languages, the local variables within a function exist for just the 
duration of that function's execution. Once makeFunc() finishes executing, you might expect that the name variable would no longer be accessible. 
However, because the code still works as expected, this is obviously not the case in JavaScript.
The reason is that functions in JavaScript form closures. A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was 
declared. This environment consists of any local variables that were in-scope at the time the closure was created. 
In this case, myFunc is a reference to the instance of the function displayName that is created when makeFunc is run. 
The instance of displayName maintains a reference to its lexical environment, within which the variable name exists. 
For this reason, when myFunc is invoked, the variable name remains available for use, and "Mozilla" is passed to console.log.



Consider the following example code : 2
function outerFunction(){
    let i = 0;
    function innerFunction(){
        i += 1;
        return i;
    }
    return innerFunction;
}

let x = outerFunction();     // Here outerFunction() return innerFunction and we store it in x and call it x() basically innerFunction(). Therefore, printing 1 & 2
// console.log(x());        // prints 1
// console.log(x());        // prints 2

// if only written outerFunction() again and again we will only get 1 because here closure every time initialize it with new value i.e; i = 0.

for(let i=0; i<5; i++){
    console.log(x());
}

/*
Output Of Loop Will Be
1
2
3
4
5
*/

How this possible ? bcz if we return the inner function then how the value is incrementing ? Due to closures
Closures initialize the value of i when initial parsing is going on when we increment the value the same memory location of i will be incremented
