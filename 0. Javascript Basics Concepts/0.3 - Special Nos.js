// There are some special nos in javascript : 0, -ve 0, NaN, Infinity, -Infinity

/* Negative 0 or -ve 0 - It indicates directional properties. Like a game subway suffer where velocity = 0 m/s but the player is facing 
forward or backwards is indicated by -ve Zero.
Neagtive Zero is considered as falsy value in javascript */

// NaN - When you are bound to return a no, but there is no possible no to return then we return Nan(Not a Number)
console.log(undefined / null);  // return NaN bcz no possible no to return... basically an undividable situation
// A intersecting property of NaN is; it is the only no in javascript which is not equal to itself

// Infinity and -Infinity both are nos in Javascript.
